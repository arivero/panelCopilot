While not providing agentic help on the document structure, a lot of extensions (elmo, glasp, perplexity, monica, maxai, sider, &c. &c. ) are at least
able to extract text and summaries of a webpage, youtube video etc. There are a very few open source ones:

  -  [Page Assist](https://github.com/n4ze3m/page-assist) according to an image in the [extension store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/page-assist-una-web-ui-pa/jfgfiigpkhlkbnfnbobbkinehhfdhndo)
